What is Behodler
    -state problem with token pairs 
Brief advantages of Behodler 
    - low gas 
    - limitless direct composition (no routing, no size restrictions)
    - impermanent loss (opportunity cost) declines
breakdown of parts (bonding curves, lachesis, SCX, pyrotokens)
    - mathematically derive bonding curves
Philosophy of Behodler 
    - impermanent loss strategies: more tokens, fees, liquidity mining
    - capture MEV mention SCX automining
    - Pyrotokens and burning 
    - contrast with liquidity volume incentives of other AMMs
Understanding SCX in more detail 
    - marginal price management implications: volatility etc
    - contrasted with LP tokens.
    - residual liquidity, burning and lower bound group loss (figure out term for Behodler's impermanent loss)
    - modern portfolio theory (https://youtu.be/T7z4yVOEsB8) suggests volatility and return imply diversify assets. No way to know in advance.
Design tradeoffs
    - weird bonding curves and AVB/TVB
    - all in one contract -> governance required
    - fixes to allow for post governance token addition
Ecosystem expansion with reference to tradeoffs and philosophy (limbo and beyond)
    - Flan compliment to SCX
    - Limbo possible use cases:
        - migration
        - initial token launch
        - regular staking
        - stake and burn.
    - Bonfire and residual liquidity
Governance 
    - Morgoth Philosophy with LimboDAO as first implementation
